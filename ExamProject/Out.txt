This is project 22 about Variational method with Lagrange multipliers
We start with a small input test matrix:

         1          4          1 
         4          1          4 
         1          4          1 
The lowest eigenvalue should be 7.179 with the normalized eigenvector (0.522, 0.674, 0.522)
The lowest calucalted eigenvalue is 7.17882224156012 with the eigenvector (0.521581577418057, 0.67530580541671, 0.521581577418057) 

Now we investigate the scaling of the method
