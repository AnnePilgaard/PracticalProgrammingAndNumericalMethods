Small input test matrix is

         1          4          1 
         4          1          4 
         1          4          1 
The lowest eigenvalue should be 7.179 with the normalized eigenvector (0.522, 0.674, 0.522)
The lowest calucalted eigenvalue is 7.17882224156012 with the eigenvector (0.521581577418057, 0.67530580541671, 0.521581577418057)
